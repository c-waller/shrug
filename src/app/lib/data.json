I have no motivation to study for them, I already passed these classes but I know I should and I will. I am terrified cause especially one of these exams is in the hardest class I’ve ever taken and even though I passed mathematically it still scares me for some reason. I feel relief that it’s almost over, but I’m depressed that it’s not over yet. Overall just kinda unsure how to manage all these emotions."

It doesn't matter if you're embarrassed to have made a mistake. Every price you pay to fix the situation is worth not going the wrong way, and starting to go the right way. Not having the courage to get off means going to the wrong destination. This, of course, isn't about trains. It's about life."
